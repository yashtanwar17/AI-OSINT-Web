# 🔍 AI Web Scanner – OSINT & Vulnerability Assessment Tool

A modular, AI-powered web reconnaissance and vulnerability scanner that helps automate the discovery of security issues and OSINT data for a given domain. This project is designed to be free, extensible, and easy to modify, with a basic structure that can be improved further.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🧠 **AI Log Analysis**  
  Converts raw `log.txt` scan output into a human-readable report using a language model (via the SambaNova API).

- 🔍 **Recon & OSINT Modules**
  - Directory listing check
  - Employee enumeration (via search/dorking)
  - Expired domain checks
  - Email discovery using Google dorking
  - Subdomain takeover detection
  - Typosquatting scan
  - Admin panel finder
  - DNS/SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation

- 💻 **Web & CMS Vulnerability Detection**
  - Outdated CMS versions + known CVEs
  - JavaScript CDN inspection with Retire.js
  - Insecure headers detection
  - SSL misconfiguration scan
  - XSS vulnerability tester
  - Basic port scanner (non-Nmap)

- 🌐 **HTML Report UI**
  - Simple Flask app to view AI-analyzed reports in a clean format.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Notes

> This is a **basic starter framework** with several useful modules, but it is **not a fully advanced tool yet**.

- More detailed and deep scans will be added in the future.
- Several tools/modules still require enhancement or replacement with more robust alternatives.
- This project intentionally **avoids paid APIs** like Shodan, HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP), or Hunter.io — to keep it free and open.
- Using paid APIs **can significantly boost** the quality and depth of this scanner.
- Some modules (like CVE lookup) use external tools like `whatweb`, `retire.js`, and `node.js`. Please ensure they are installed and correctly configured in your environment.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for Retire.js)
- `whatweb` installed and accessible in your environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (create your own with needed packages)

### External Dependencies:

- ✅ **SambaNova API**  
  Used for AI-based log interpretation. *(You can replace this with a local LLM like LLaMA or GPTQ for better security.)*

- ✅ **DNSDumpster API**  
  Used for subdomain enumeration in `sdtakeover.py`. You must supply your own valid API key.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration & Customization

- Modify `main.py` to change the scanning sequence or inputs.
- Run `flaskweb.py`
- then run `main.py` and wait, try refreshing flask web for report.
- Update or replace `sdtakeover.py` and other modules with your own keys/configs — **your API keys will not work with mine**.
- Want better accuracy or features? Integrate paid services like:
  - Shodan (host detection, ports, vulnerabilities)
  - HIBP (email breach detection)
  - Hunter.io (email discovery)

---

## 💡 Roadmap & Ideas

This is just a basic version. Planned improvements include:

- Vulnerability scoring (CVSS integration)
- Auto-patching suggestions
- Subdomain bruteforcing
- SQLi, LFI/RFI checks
- WordPress and other CMS plugins/themes scanner
- Multi-threaded or async performance boost
- Containerization (Docker support)

---

## 🙋 Troubleshooting

- **Some modules may fail or show errors** if:
  - Tools like `retire`, `whatweb`, or `node` aren't installed correctly.
  - APIs aren't set or configured for your environment.
- If something breaks, feel free to open an issue.
